# `Join-Path` fails if the path drive does not exist

The script [Test-missing-drive.ps1](Test-missing-drive.ps1) finds a missing drive and uses it in order
to join paths by the .NET method `Path.Combine()` (works) and by PowerShell
cmdlet `Join-Path` (fails).

### Join-Path with UNC paths: mind the current provider

When `Join-Path` is used with UNC paths then the results may depend on the
current provider. If it is accidentally not *FileSystem* then it may be a
mistake. The script [Test-mind-the-provider.ps1](Test-mind-the-provider.ps1) shows the issue.
